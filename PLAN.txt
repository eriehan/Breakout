1.
Among the variants of breakout, I personally found Bricks n Balls the most interesting.
Aiming mechanism from Bubble Shooter Game grasped my attention, and I actually downloaded a Brick n Ball game and played it.
It turned out to be extremely fun, as I constantly had to think about taking a shot that would make my next few shots easier.

2. Different levels
In the resources directory, there are 5 text files, each showing what each level will look like.
0 -> empty
1 -> brick has one life
2 -> brick has two lives
3 -> brick has three lives
4 -> brick has four lives
5 -> brick has five lives
P -> permanent brick
M -> brick that moves. Has one life


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Types of Bricks
Some bricks will have one life. When the level gets higher, there will be bricks with two, three, or four lives.
There will be permanent bricks when the player reaches higher levels.
At the highest level, there will be bricks that moves horizontally, making it hard for the player to hit the brick.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Power Ups
When a brick disappears, it may turn into a power-up item which will slowly drop towards the lower boundary.
There will be a cheat key that increases the possibility of each brick turning into a power-up item.
If the player fails to get the item with the paddle and the item drops below the lower boundary, it's gone.

There will be five types of power-ups.

First power-up will give an extra life to the player.

Second power-up will give players 3~5 "Bombs". Clicking the space bar will make the paddle shoot a bomb (probably circular) upwards.
If the bomb hits a brick, it will take one life from that brick.
However, if the player makes a mistake and the bomb hits the ball, the ball will disappear and the player loses a life.

Third power-up will make the paddle longer. The effect will last until the player gets another power-up with different effect.

Fourth power-up will form one or two more balls.

Fifth power-up will give the paddle the 'magnetic power'. That power will disappear if the player gets another power-up.

5. Cheat Keys

1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> move to the corresponding level.
L -> extra life.
B -> extra bomb.
P -> Makes the paddle longer. Press P again and it will be even longer. Pressing P again will make it return to its original length
M -> Gives 'magnetic power' to the paddle. Press M again to turn it off.
I -> Items that give power-up will appear more often. Press I again to cancel the effect.
R -> puts paddle and ball to their starting position. If there were more than one balls before pressing this key,
    there will be only one ball left after pressing this key.
F -> Paddle becomes faster. Press F again to cancel the effect.
W -> Paddle will warp from one side of the screen to the other when it reaches the edge. Press W again to cancel the effect.

6. Additions to the program.

i. Paddle
Hitting the ball with central part of the paddle will make the ball bounce normally.
Hitting the ball with the left/right part of the paddle will make the ball bounce more toward left/right(probably 10~20 degrees more).

Getting the magnetic power-up or pressing 'M' will give the paddle the magnetic power. The paddle will hold the ball,
and release the ball when the player presses the 'enter' key.

There will be a cheat key that lets the paddle warp from one side to the other when it reaches the edge of the screen.



ii. extra plans

At the start of a new level, or when the player loses a life, the ball will be at the center of the paddle.
The paddle will shoot the ball at a random direction to make the game fun.
