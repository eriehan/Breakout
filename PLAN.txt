Among the variants of breakout, I personally found Bricks n Balls the most interesting.
Aiming mechanism from Bubble Shooter Game grasped my attention, and I actually downloaded a Brick n Ball game and played it.
It turned out to be extremely fun, as I constantly had to think about taking a shot that would make my next few shots easier.

2. Different levels
First level will be an easy tutorial. There will just be a line of bricks with one life, and the ball will move slowly.
Second level will contain some bricks with two lives, and the ball will move faster. There will be more bricks.
Third level will contain some bricks with three or four lives, and the ball will move faster.
Fourth level will contain some bricks that move horizontally.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Types of Bricks
Some bricks will have one life. When the level gets higher, there will be bricks with two, three, or four lives.
There will be permanent bricks when the player reaches higher levels.
At the highest level, there will be bricks that moves horizontally, making it hard for the player to hit the brick.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Power Ups
When a brick disappears, it may turn into a power-up item which will slowly drop towards the lower boundary.
There will be a cheat key that increases the possibility of each brick turning into a power-up item.
If the player fails to get the item with the paddle and the item drops below the lower boundary, it's gone.

There will be five types of power-ups.

First power-up will give an extra life to the player.

Second power-up will give players 3~5 "Bombs". Clicking the space bar will make the paddle shoot a bomb (probably circular) upwards.
If the bomb hits a brick, it will take one life from that brick.
However, if the player makes a mistake and the bomb hits the ball before it hits a brick, the ball will explode and the player loses a life.

Third power-up will make the paddle longer. The effect will last until the player gets another power-up with different effect.

Fourth power-up will form one or two more balls.

Fifth power-up will give the paddle the 'magnetic power'. That power will disappear if the player gets another power-up.

5. Cheat Keys

1, 2, 3 -> move to the corresponding level.
L -> extra life.
B -> extra bomb.
P -> Makes the paddle longer.
M -> Gives 'magnetic power' to the paddle. Press M again to turn it off.
I -> Items that give power-up will appear more often. Press I again to cancel the effect.
R -> puts paddle and ball to their starting position. If there were more than one balls before pressing this key,
    there will be only one ball left after pressing this key.

6. Additions to the program.

i. Paddle
Hitting the ball with central part of the paddle will make the ball bounce normally.
Hitting the ball with the left/right part of the paddle will make the ball bounce more toward left/right(15~25 degrees more).

Getting the magnetic power-up or pressing 'M' will give the paddle the magnetic power. The paddle will hold the ball,
and release the ball when the player presses the 'enter' key.


ii. extra plans

At the start of a new level, or when the player loses a life, the ball will be at the center of the paddle. Only when the player presses
the required key (enter or space) will the ball start moving.

The angle of the ball's direction will be random to make the game more fun. But the ball will not go downwards because that will
force the player to lose a life!x
