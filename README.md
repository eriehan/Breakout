### Running the Program

Main class: BreakOutGame.java

Data files needed: lv1.txt, lv2.txt, lv3.txt, lv4.txt, lv5.txt

Key/Mouse inputs:
Left -> paddle moves left.
Right -> paddle moves right
Enter -> At the start of each level, or when the player loses a life, the ball will appear on
the top of the paddle. Pressing the enter key will make the paddle 'shoot' the ball at a random
direction.

Cheat keys:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> move to that level. Once this key is pressed, everything on the screen
except the paddle will disappear, and a new level map will be created. The paddle will
be in the starting position. A new ball will appear on the middle of the paddle.

P -> Paddle gets wider. Press P again and it reach the maximum width at that level. 
Pressing P when the paddle's width is the maximum width will force the paddle to come back
to its original length.

R -> Resets that paddle and the ball to its original position.

W -> The paddle can warp through one side of the screen to the other side of the screen.
