### Running the Program

Main class: BreakOutGame.java

Data files needed: lv1.txt, lv2.txt, lv3.txt, lv4.txt, lv5.txt

Key/Mouse inputs:
Left -> paddle moves left.
Right -> paddle moves right
Enter -> At the start of each level, or when the player loses a life, the ball will appear on
the top of the paddle. Pressing the enter key will make the paddle 'shoot' the ball at a random
direction.

Cheat keys:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> Let me go to that level
P -> Make my paddle longer...or maybe shorter!
W -> Turn my paddle's warp power on/off!
L -> (Cheat) Gimme more life!
B -> (Cheat) Gimme more bombs!
R -> (Cheat) Let me reset my position!
N -> (Cheat) Gimme more balls!
M -> Turn my paddle's magnetic power on/off!
S -> Make my ball slower! (min speed = pressing S two times)
Q -> Make my ball faster! (max speed = pressing Q two times)
I -> Gimme items more/less often!
F -> Make my paddle faster...or maybe slower! (max speed = pressing F two times, and the 
paddle gets to minimum speed when you press F again at that state.)

Known Bugs:
When the speed of the ball gets very high at level 5 (after pressing Q two times and reaching the highest 
possible ball speed in the game), I have found that the ball can be locked at the top of the screen
for a few seconds.

### Notes
In PLAN.txt, I have written that there will be an item that gives the paddle a magnetic power.
I decided not to implement that in my code as I realized that the magnetic power was a power so strong
that it could ruin the fun of the game, especially because of the 
Thus, I decided that
